Tried different methods to solve the shaders problem.

# June 28, 2022

I spent my whole day learning by reading blogs of WebGL to solve the problem of shaders.

The mandelbort set was difficult to generate. First I tried wrong logic to generate the set and playing with the shaders if they work. Multiple and different types of error came, one after another, and I was unable to generate the set. The next problem was how to customize the shaders to color each pixel differnetly. That on was the most difficult problem.

After the regular polygon thing I was assigned to write a simple WebGL program that draws madelbrot set.

The regular polygon thing was completed. Sir looked into it and appreciated the work.

Most part of the regualr polygons was done with html file ready to be used.
