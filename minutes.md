-   We discussed the camera and the viewing volume, and how that works in WebGL.
-   We talk about the different stages of pipeline, prominantly, vetex shader and fragment shader.
-   We look some of the examples of WebGL program from simple to more complex.
-   After this Dr Waqar assigned me two tasks:
    -   Write a simple WebGL program that draws polygons.
    -   Write a WebGL program that generates and shades a mandelbrot set.
